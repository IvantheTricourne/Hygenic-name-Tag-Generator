# The (simple) Name Tag Generator

This is a simple HTML app written using Elm. Using it is easy!

```
elm make Shine.elm
```

Then open `index.html`. Alternatively, if you have `elm` and `npm` installed,
then from the root of this directory, you can start an elm-reactor with
`elm reactor` and then navigate to `localhost:8000/Shine.elm` in your favorite
browser.
